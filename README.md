# ShaCollisionFinder
Build two PDFs that have different content but identical SHA-1 hashes. 

Select two image files on a computer and these picture files must have the same size: height of the first picture = height of the second picture and width of the first picture = width of the second picture. 
Attention: These images will be converted to jpeg, so that the size of the resulting jpeg was less than 64 KiB

Choose how to save pdf files.
Click the Button "Build Collisions!". As a result, 2 pdf files with the same SHA-1 hash are generated, but with different contents: the contents of the first = the first picture, the contents of the second = the second picture.
